talk plan 

five minutes on the questions that led to this ending with Liskov and data abstraction, you need a slide with data abstraction and inheritance, and then one with some thing about CLU

next structured programming and design, Dykstra, Niklaus Wirth, stepwise refinement… Software crisis. slides with good quotes maybe papers from each

next control abstraction and functional abstraction need slide with assembly language for procedure calls and conditional statements or loops,

introduce Parnas and information hiding encapsulation, let’s golf career, FORTRAN and Venus,
petitions and partitions and teens

CLU language and the design, talk about the sources and the features of clue ending with Clijsters, can talk about the solutions to problems with data abstraction

giraffe at this video you need conclusions about CLU and introduction for inheritance and maybe you can talk about Smalltalk and the West Coast
